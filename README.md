# Coding Interview Practice Problems

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to various coding interview practice problems from LeetCode and other platforms. The purpose of this repository is to track my progress and share solutions with others studying for software engineering interviews.

## Repository Structure
- `LeetCode`: Contains solutions to problems from LeetCode.
  - `/Typescript`
  - `/C++`

- `DataStructires`

## DataStructures

In the `DataStructures` directory, you'll find my personal implementations of various data structures along with helpful utility functions. These implementations are written to demonstrate the concepts and provide a deeper understanding of how these data structures work under the hood.

Here's what you can expect in this directory:

- **Full Implementations**: This includes classes and structures for common data structures like linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, and graphs. Each implementation is accompanied by thorough documentation explaining the methods and their usage.

- **Helper Functions**: For each data structure, there are additional helper functions to make common operations like traversal, insertion, deletion, and searching more efficient and easier to handle.

- - **External Resources**: This will also contain resources I used to help me solve my LeetCode problems, such as NeetCode, Stack OverFlow, Youtube Videos, etc.
    
## Engage with the Project
While this is a personal portfolio, your insights and discussions are welcome:
- **Issue Reporting**: Found a bug or an inconsistency? Open an issue.
- **Enhancements**: Have suggestions for optimization or clarity? Share your thoughts via issues.
- **Discussions**: Use issues for discussions on problem-solving approaches or concepts.
- **Resource Sharing**: Know a great resource that complements a problem? Feel free to share!

## Note
This project is for educational purposes and reflects my journey in coding practice. Contributions are not required, but your engagement and feedback are much appreciated.
